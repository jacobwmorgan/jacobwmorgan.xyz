[{"content":"Im Jacob, a 21 year old Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln. I am currently a software dev working with mostly ruby on rails.\nComputer Science # I graduated from university with a first in Computer science, finalising my degree with my disseration. The disseration focused on machine learning, specially proving which out of three models are best for classifying mushrooms üçÑ\nThe langauges I am most comfortable with are -\nPython C# C++ MatLab I also use Linux, currently running Ubuntu, and love to use open source software. I write most of my stuff in markdown or LaTeX.\nFor more information of my projects checkout my github and resume.\nHobbies # I have quite a lot of hobbies, most of which I do daily. Most of my hobbies aren‚Äôt related to computers, since a break is needed to stop me from going insane.\nMusic # I play a few instruments and sing. I play\nAcoustic Guitar (I play this the most) Electric Guitar Bass Guitar (Now and again) Piano (I have just started teaching myself, gave my keyboard back to my father so I can\u0026rsquo;t really play anymore) I post a lot of my music to Spotify, Bandcamp and Soundcloud. Most of my music is quite lo-fi since I don‚Äôt have time to go to the studio (nor the money).\nI also catalogue a lot of the music I listen to on Spotify. You can find my profile here. I use Spotify way too much lol.\nI also have a decently sized record collection, I try to keep my Discogs updated but sometimes I just forget. You can find that here.\nReading # I‚Äôd like to say I read a lot but to be honest, I only read when im feeling it, so maybe three or four times a week. I try to read multiple books at once, one academic or non-fiction and one fiction. Currently, I am reading:\nKitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly - Anthony Bourdain (This book is awesome, makes me wanna quit being a dev and go be a chef) Why marx was right - Terry Eagleton You can sorta guess my political views and interests based upon what im reading lmao\nLifting # I have been lifting for around 4-5 years now, with a huge break in the pandemic. Consistently I have been training specifically for powerlifting for 3 out of those years with a huge focus recently on general strength and aesthetics. I train three times a week and currently follow a pretty standard program, Strong lifts 5x5. Recently since moving back home I have started madcow 5x5 and have seen a massive increase in strength. This could also be due to how much food im eating lol\nI got into strength training in six-form after a couple of friends introduced me to it. As my granddad used to compete in powerlifting, he taught me most of the lifts. I train now mostly for fun and the fact it‚Äôs ingrained into my routines. I don‚Äôt intend on competing, but given the chance why not.\nI squat like 3 times a week, i really like squatting. Ass to grass just like tom platz.\n","date":"15 June 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"jacobwmorgan","summary":"Im Jacob, a 21 year old Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/","section":"jacobwmorgan","summary":"Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln","title":"jacobwmorgan"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
