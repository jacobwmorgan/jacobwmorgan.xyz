Im Jacob, a 20 year old student currently finishing my BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cmpcmsub/). 
## Computer Science 
I am currently writing my disseration in machine learning, specifically looking into models to classify mushrooms. 

In my spare time I like to learn new languages and create small personal projects (projects are listed on the [home page](/)).

The programming languages that I am most confident in are:
- Python
- C# 
- C++
- MatLab  

The markdown languages that I use are:
- Markdown 
- LaTeX

Since attending University I have learnt and learned so much. I study quite a lot and even publish [my notes](https://cloud-hyacinth-ea4.notion.site/Comp-Sci-Notes-and-Resources-f1247d21e7594ce6864925df8635bc07) for others to use.
