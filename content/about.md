Im Jacob, a 20-year-old student currently finishing my BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cmpcmsub/).

## Computer Science

I am currently writing my dissertation in machine learning, specifically looking into models to classify mushrooms. 

In my spare time, I like to learn new languages and create small personal projects (projects are listed on the [home page](/)).

The programming languages that I am most confident in are:

- Python
- C#
- C++
- MatLab  

The markdown languages that I use are:

- Markdown  
- LaTeX

Since attending University I have learnt so much about computer science. I study quite a lot and even publish [my notes](https://cloud-hyacinth-ea4.notion.site/Comp-Sci-Notes-and-Resources-f1247d21e7594ce6864925df8635bc07) for others to use.

## Hobbies

I have quite a lot of hobbies, most of which I do daily. Most of my hobbies aren't related to computers, since a break is needed to stop me from going insane.

### Music

I play a few instruments and sing. I play 

- Acoustic Guitar
- Electric Guitar
- Bass Guitar (Now and again)
- Piano (I have just started teaching myself)

I post a lot of my music to Spotify, Bandcamp and Soundcloud. Most of my music is quite lo-fi since I don't have time to go to the studio (nor the money).

I also catalogue a lot of the music I listen to on Spotify. You can find my profile [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/1177473688). I use Spotify way too much lol.

I also have a decently sized record collection, I try to keep my Discogs updated but sometimes I just forget. You can find that [here](https://www.discogs.com/user/jakey23/collection).

### Reading

I'd like to say I read a lot but to be honest, I only read when im feeling it, so maybe three or four times a week.
I try to read multiple books at once, one academic or non-fiction and one fiction. 
Currently, I am reading:

- The Creativity Code by Marcus du Sautoy (Second time reading)
- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick

### Sports

I have been lifting for around 4-5 years now, with a huge break in the pandemic. Consistently I have been training specifically for powerlifting for 3 out of those years with a huge focus recently on general strength and aesthetics. I train three times a week and currently follow a pretty standard program, [Strong lifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/).

I got into strength training in six-form after a couple of friends introduced me to it. As my granddad used to compete in powerlifting, he taught me most of the lifts. I train now mostly for fun and the fact it's ingrained into my routines. I don't intend on competing, but given the chance why not.

My current max lifts are:

- Squat 130kgx1
- Bench 95x1
- Deadlift 175x1
  
It's cool watching numbers increase, especially when they're not in a video game.
