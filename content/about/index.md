Im Jacob, a 21 year old Computer Science graduate from the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/course/cmpcmsub/). I am currently looking for a graduate software engineering role.  

## Computer Science 

I graduated from university with a first in Computer science, finalising my degree with my disseration. The disseration focused on machine learning, specially proving which out of three models are best for classifying mushrooms üçÑ 
<!-- {{< github repo="jacobwmorgan/champignons" >}} -->





The langauges I am most comfortable with are -
-  Python
-  C#
-  C++
-  MatLab

I also use Linux, currently running Ubuntu, and love to use open source software. I write most of my stuff in markdown or LaTeX.

For more information of my projects checkout my [github](https://github.com/jacobwmorgan) and [resume](/resume).

## Hobbies

I have quite a lot of hobbies, most of which I do daily. Most of my hobbies aren‚Äôt related to computers, since a break is needed to stop me from going insane.

### Music
I play a few instruments and sing. I play
- Acoustic Guitar
- Electric Guitar
- Bass Guitar (Now and again)
- Piano (I have just started teaching myself, gave my keyboard back to my father so I can't really play anymore)

I post a lot of my music to Spotify, Bandcamp and Soundcloud. Most of my music is quite lo-fi since I don‚Äôt have time to go to the studio (nor the money).

I also catalogue a lot of the music I listen to on Spotify. You can find my profile [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/1177473688). I use Spotify way too much lol.

I also have a decently sized record collection, I try to keep my Discogs updated but sometimes I just forget. You can find that [here](https://www.discogs.com/user/jakey23).

### Reading

I‚Äôd like to say I read a lot but to be honest, I only read when im feeling it, so maybe three or four times a week. I try to read multiple books at once, one academic or non-fiction and one fiction. Currently, I am reading:

- Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher
- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick

You can sorta guess my political views and interests based upon what im reading lmao

### Lifting

I have been lifting for around 4-5 years now, with a huge break in the pandemic. Consistently I have been training specifically for powerlifting for 3 out of those years with a huge focus recently on general strength and aesthetics. I train three times a week and currently follow a pretty standard program, Strong lifts 5x5.

I got into strength training in six-form after a couple of friends introduced me to it. As my granddad used to compete in powerlifting, he taught me most of the lifts. I train now mostly for fun and the fact it‚Äôs ingrained into my routines. I don‚Äôt intend on competing, but given the chance why not.

It‚Äôs cool watching numbers increase, especially when they‚Äôre not in a video game. I dont eat my macros properly due to being dirt poor, but hopefully that will change.

I squat like 3 times a week, i really like squatting. Ass to grass just like tom platz.
